This is a workflow to extract contour from zebrafish embryo images.
The codes work on Google Scholar.
The code "pipeline_colab.ipynb" is for a 2D image.
The code "pipeline_colab_4d.ipynb" is for an image stack with a dimension higher than 3.
Â 
Input images should be a grayscale TIF image or a stack.
The resulting image is a binary image in TIFF format.
Please adjust the contrast to a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1.
